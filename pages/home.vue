        The idea of Well Within Farm Sanctuary was planted with the intention of
        being more than a traditional farm. Its need was sprouted from the
        necessity to become sustainable in not only traditional farm practices
        but in many aspects of life.

        Well Within Farm Sanctuary Is a place where a person can learn a skill,

        magical event or gathering, relax in a wood fired sauna, plant a seed,
        eat pizza baked in an earthen oven, donate to a worthy cause, farm an
        idea, and cultivate peace well within their hearts and minds.
